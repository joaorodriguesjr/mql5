Classes for Creating Control Panels and Dialogs

This section contains technical details of working with classes for creation of controls panels and dialogs, as well as description of the relevant components of the MQL5 standard library.

The use of these classes will save time when developing custom interactive MQL5 applications, including Expert Advisors and indicators.

MQL5 Standard Library (in terms of classes for creation of control panels and dialogs) is placed in the terminal data folder, in the MQL5\Include\Controls.

Find the examples of working with classes in the following articles:

* [How to create a graphical panel of any complexity level](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/4503)
* [Improving Panels: Adding transparency, changing background color and inheriting from CAppDialog/CWndClient](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/4575)
* [Adding a control panel to an indicator or an Expert Advisor in no time](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2171)
* [Create your own graphical panels in MQL5](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/345)
* [Creating active control panels in MQL5 for trading](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/62)

The sample Expert Advisor, which illustrates the operation of these classes, can be found in MQL5\Expert\Examples\Controls.
