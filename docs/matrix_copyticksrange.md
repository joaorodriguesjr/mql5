CopyTicksRange

Get ticks from an [MqlTick](mqltick.md) structure into a matrix or a vector within the specified date range. Elements are counted from the past to the present, which means that the tick with index 0 is the oldest one. To analyze a tick, check the [flags](matrix_copyticksrange.md#flags) field which shows what exactly has changed in the tick.

```
bool  matrix::CopyTicksRange(
   string           symbol,                // symbol name
   ulong            flags,                 // flag indicating the type of ticks to be received 
   ulong            from_msc,              // time from which ticks are requested
   ulong            to_msc                 // time up to which ticks are requested
   );
```

Vector Method

```
bool  vector::CopyTicksRange(
   string           symbol,                // symbol name
   ulong            flags,                 // flag indicating the type of ticks to be received 
   ulong            from_msc,              // time from which ticks are requested
   ulong            to_msc                 // time up to which ticks are requested
   );
```

Parameters

symbol

[in]  Symbol.

flags

[in]  A combination of flags from the [ENUM\_COPY\_TICKS](matrix_copyticks.md#enum_copy_ticks) enumeration indicating the contents of the requested data. When copying to a vector, you can specify only one value from the ENUM\_COPY\_TICKS enumeration, otherwise an error will occur.

from\_msc

[in]  Time starting from which ticks are requested. Time is specified in milliseconds since 01/01/1970. If the 'from\_msc' parameter is not specified, ticks from the beginning of the history are returned. Ticks with the time >= from\_msc will be returned.

to\_msc

[in]  Time up to which ticks are requested. Time is specified in milliseconds since 01/01/1970. Ticks with the time <= to\_msc are returned. If the to\_msc parameter is not specified, all ticks up to the history end are returned.

Return Value

Returns true on success or false if error occurs. [GetLastError()](getlasterror.md) can return the following errors:

* ERR\_HISTORY\_TIMEOUT timeout for tick synchronization has expired, the function has returned all it had.
* ERR\_HISTORY\_SMALL\_BUFFER static buffer is too small. Only the amount the array can store has been returned.
* ERR\_NOT\_ENOUGH\_MEMORY not enough memory to receive historical data from the specified range into a dynamic tick array. Failed to allocate enough memory for the tick array.

 

Analyze the tick flags to find out which data has changed:

* TICK\_FLAG\_BID the tick has changed the bid price
* TICK\_FLAG\_ASK the tick has changed the ask price
* TICK\_FLAG\_LAST the tick has changed the last deal price
* TICK\_FLAG\_VOLUME the tick has changed the volume
* TICK\_FLAG\_BUY the tick is a result of a buy deal
* TICK\_FLAG\_SELL the tick is a result of a sell deal

 

Note

The CopyTicksRange() method is used to request ticks from exactly the specified range. For example, ticks for a specific day in history. CopyTicks() allows specifying only the start date, for example, to receive all ticks from the beginning of the month up to now.
