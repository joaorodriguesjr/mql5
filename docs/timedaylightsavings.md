```
void OnStart()
  {
//--- get daylight saving time adjustment in seconds
   int sec_dl=TimeDaylightSavings();
   
//--- create the text describing the received value
   string text=(sec_dl==0 ? "Standard \"winter\" time is used" : 
                StringFormat("Daylight saving time has been switched over. The correction is %d seconds", sec_dl));
   
//--- display a description of the daylight saving time adjustment in seconds in the log
   Print(text);
   /*
   result for "winter" time:
   Standard "winter" time is used
   
   result for "summer" time:
   Daylight saving time has been switched over. The correction is -3600 seconds
