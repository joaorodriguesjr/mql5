Signals of the Oscillator Commodity Channel Index

This module of signals is based on the market models of the oscillator [Commodity Channel Index](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci). The mechanism of making trade decisions based on signals obtained from the modules is described in a [separate section](csignal.md#mechanism).

Conditions of Generation of Signals

Below you can find the description of conditions when the module passes a signal to an Expert Advisor.

| Signal Type | Description of Conditions |
| --- | --- |
| For buying | * Reverse behind the oversold level the oscillator turned upwards and its value at the analyzed bar is behind the level of oversold level (default value is -100).   Commodity Channel Index - Buy Signal      * Divergence the first analyzed bottom of the oscillator is higher than the previous one, and the corresponding price bottom is lower than the previous one.   Commodity Channel Index - Buy Signal      * Double divergence the oscillator formed three consequent bottoms, each of them is higher than the previous one; and the price formed three corresponding bottoms, and each of them is lower than the previous one.   Commodity Channel Index - Buy Signal |
| For selling | * Reverse behind the overbought level the oscillator turned downwards and its value at the analyzed bar is behind the overbought level (default value is 100).   Commodity Channel Index - Sell Signal      * Divergence the first analyzed peak of the oscillator is lower than the previous one, and the corresponding price peak is higher than the previous peak.   Commodity Channel Index - Sell Signal      * Double divergence the oscillator formed three consequent peaks, each of them is lower than the previous one; and the price formed three corresponding peaks, each of them is higher than the previous one.   Commodity Channel Index - Sell Signal |
| No objections to buying | Value of the oscillator grows at the analyzed bar. |
| No objections to selling | Value of the oscillator falls at the analyzed bar. |

Note

Depending on the mode of operation of an Expert Advisor ("Every tick" or "Open prices only") an analyzed bar is either the current bar (with index 0), or the last formed bar (with index 1).

Adjustable Parameters

This module has the following adjustable parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Weight | Weight of signal of the module in the interval 0 to 1. |
| PeriodCCI | Period of calculation of the oscillator. |
| Applied | A [price series](prices.md#enum_applied_price_enum) used for calculation of the oscillator. |
