Signals of the Oscillator MACD

This module of signals is based on the market models of the oscillator [MACD](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/macd). The mechanism of making trade decisions based on signals obtained from the modules is described in a [separate section](csignal.md#mechanism).

Conditions of Generation of Signals

Below you can find the description of conditions when the module passes a signal to an Expert Advisor.

| Signal Type | Description of Conditions |
| --- | --- |
| For buying | * Reverse the oscillator turned upwards (the oscillator rises at the analyzed bar and falls at the previous one).   MACD - Buy Signal      * Crossover of the main and signal line the main line is above the signal line at the analyzed bar and below the signal line at the previous one.   MACD - Buy Signal      * Crossing the zero level the main line is above the zero level at the analyzed bar and below the zero level at the previous one.   MACD - Buy Signal      * Divergence the first analyzed bottom of the oscillator is higher than the previous one, and the corresponding price bottom is lower than the previous one.   MACD - Buy Signal      * Double divergence the oscillator forms three consequent bottoms, each of them is higher than the previous one; and the price formed three corresponding bottoms, and each of them is lower than the previous one.   MACD - Buy Signal |
| For selling | * Reverse the oscillator turned downwards (the oscillator falls at the analyzed bar and rises at the previous one).   MACD - Sell Signal      * Crossover of the main and signal line the main line is below the signal line at the analyzed bar and above the signal line at the previous one.   MACD - Sell Signal      * Crossing the zero level the main line is below the zero level at the analyzed bar and above the zero level at the previous one.   MACD - Sell Signal      * Divergence the first analyzed peak of the oscillator is lower than the previous one, and the corresponding price peak is higher than the previous peak.   MACD - Sell Signal      * Double divergence the oscillator formed three consequent peaks, each of them is lower than the previous one; and the price formed three corresponding peaks, each of them is higher than the previous one.   MACD - Sell Signal |
| No objections to buying | Value of the oscillator grows at the analyzed bar. |
| No objections to selling | Value of the oscillator falls at the analyzed bar. |

Note

Depending on the mode of operation of an Expert Advisor ("Every tick" or "Open prices only") an analyzed bar is either the current bar (with index 0), or the last formed bar (with index 1).

Adjustable Parameters

This module has the following adjustable parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Weight | Weight of signal of the module in the interval 0 to 1. |
| PeriodFast | Period of calculation of the fast EMA. |
| PeriodSlow | Period of calculation of the slow EMA. |
| PeriodSignal | Period of smoothing. |
| Applied | A [price series](prices.md#enum_applied_price_enum) used for calculation of the oscillator. |
