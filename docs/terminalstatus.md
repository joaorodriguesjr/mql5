Client Terminal Properties

Information about the client terminal can be obtained by two functions: [TerminalInfoInteger()](terminalinfointeger.md) and [TerminalInfoString()](terminalinfostring.md). For parameters, these functions accept values from ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_INTEGER and ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_STRING respectively.

ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_INTEGER

| Key identifier | Description |  |
| TERMINAL\_KEYSTATE\_LEFT | State of the "Left arrow" key | int |
| TERMINAL\_KEYSTATE\_UP | State of the "Up arrow" key | int |

| TERMINAL\_KEYSTATE\_PAGEDOWN | State of the "PageDown" key | int |
| TERMINAL\_KEYSTATE\_ESCAPE | State of the "Escape" key | int |

Call to TerminalInfoInteger(TERMINAL\_KEYSTATE\_XXX) returns the same state code of a key as the [GetKeyState()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getkeystate) function in MSDN.

 

Example of scaling factor calculation:

```
//--- Creating a 1.5 inch wide button on a screen
int screen_dpi = TerminalInfoInteger(TERMINAL_SCREEN_DPI); // Find DPI of the user monitor
int base_width = 144;                                      // The basic width in the screen points for standard monitors with DPI=96
int width      = (button_width * screen_dpi) / 96;         // Calculate the button width for the user monitor (for the specific DPI)
...
 
//--- Calculating the scaling factor as a percentage
int scale_factor=(TerminalInfoInteger(TERMINAL_SCREEN_DPI) * 100) / 96;
//--- Use of the scaling factor
width=(base_width * scale_factor) / 100;
```

In the above example, the graphical [resource](resources.md) looks the same on monitors with different resolution characteristics. The size of control elements (buttons, dialog windows, etc.) corresponds to personalization settings.

 

ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_DOUBLE

| Identifier | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TERMINAL\_COMMUNITY\_BALANCE | Balance in MQL5.community | double |
| TERMINAL\_RETRANSMISSION | Percentage of resent network packets in the TCP/IP protocol for all running applications and services on the given computer. Packet loss occurs even in the fastest and correctly configured networks. In this case, there is no confirmation of packet delivery between the recipient and the sender, therefore lost packets are resent.     It is not an indication of the connection quality between a particular terminal and a trade server, since the percentage is calculated for the entire network activity, including system and background activity.     The TERMINAL\_RETRANSMISSION value is requested from the operating system once per minute. The terminal itself does not calculate this value. | double |

 

[File operations](files.md) can be performed only in two directories; corresponding paths can be obtained using the request for TERMINAL\_DATA\_PATH and TERMINAL\_COMMONDATA\_PATH properties.

ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_STRING

| Identifier | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TERMINAL\_LANGUAGE | Language of the terminal | string |
| TERMINAL\_COMPANY | Company name | string |
| TERMINAL\_NAME | Terminal name | string |
| TERMINAL\_PATH | Folder from which the terminal is started | string |
| TERMINAL\_DATA\_PATH | Folder in which terminal data are stored | string |
| TERMINAL\_COMMONDATA\_PATH | Common path for all of the terminals installed on a computer | string |
| TERMINAL\_CPU\_NAME | CPU name | string |
| TERMINAL\_CPU\_ARCHITECTURE | CPU architecture | string |
| TERMINAL\_OS\_VERSION | User's OS name | string |
| TERMINAL\_COLORTHEME\_NAME | Terminal color scheme; possible values: Light and Dark. | string |

For a better understanding of paths, stored in properties of TERMINAL\_PATH, TERMINAL\_DATA\_PATH and TERMINAL\_COMMONDATA\_PATH parameters, it is recommended to execute the script, which will return these values for the current copy of the client terminal, installed on your computer

Example: Script returns information about the client terminal paths

   Print("TERMINAL_PATH = ",TerminalInfoString(TERMINAL_PATH));
   Print("TERMINAL_DATA_PATH = ",TerminalInfoString(TERMINAL_DATA_PATH));
   Print("TERMINAL_COMMONDATA_PATH = ",TerminalInfoString(TERMINAL_COMMONDATA_PATH));
  }
```

As result of the script execution in the Experts Journal you will see a messages, like the following:

Get Terminal Color Scheme Information

The terminal supports two color schemes: Light (default) and Dark. When developing custom applications with graphical user interfaces, programmers should take the current terminal color scheme into account. Visual components used in the application should be dynamically adaptable to enhance user experience and maintain visual consistency.

To support this, the language provides functions for detecting the terminal color scheme:

* The TERMINAL\_COLORTHEME\_NAME value from the [ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_STRING](terminalstatus.md#enum_terminal_info_string) enumeration allows you to retrieve the name of the current color scheme using the [TerminalInfoString](terminalinfostring.md) function. Possible values: Light and Dark.
* Use the THEME\_COLOR\_* values from the [ENUM\_TERMINAL\_INFO\_INTEGER](terminalstatus.md#enum_terminal_info_integer) enumeration to retrieve the colors of specific UI elements through the [TerminalInfoInteger](terminalinfointeger.md) function.
