ReduceSymmetricToTridiagonal

Reduces a real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrix A to trdiagonal form B by an orthogonal similarity transformation: Q**T * A * Q = B. LAPACK functions [SYTRD](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-fortran/2025-2/sytrd.md), [HETRD](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-fortran/2025-2/hetrd.md).

Computing for type matrix<double>

```
bool  matrix::ReduceSymmetricToTridiagonal(
   matrix&         B,            // tridiagonal matrix
   matrix&         reflect_q,    // q-reflectors
   vector&         tau_q         // scalar factors of the elementary reflectors Q
   );
```

Computing for type matrix<float>

```
bool  matrix::ReduceSymmetricToTridiagonal(
   matrixf&        B,            // tridiagonal matrix
   matrixf&        reflect_q,    // q-reflectors
   vectorf&        tau_q         // scalar factors of the elementary reflectors Q
   );
```

Computing for type matrix<complex>

```
bool  matrix::ReduceSymmetricToTridiagonal(
   matrixc&        B,            // tridiagonal matrix
   matrixc&        reflect_q,    // q-reflectors
   vectorc&        tau_q         // scalar factors of the elementary reflectors Q
   );
```

Computing for type matrix<complexf>

```
bool  matrix::ReduceSymmetricToTridiagonal(
   matrixcf&       B,            // tridiagonal matrix
   matrixcf&       reflect_q,    // q and p-reflectors
   vectorcf&       tau_q         // scalar factors of the elementary reflectors Q
   );
```

Parameters

B

[out]  Symmetric (or Hermitian) tridiagonal matrix.

reflect\_q

[out] Upper or lower triangular matrix, it depends on the input matrix A. In upper case the diagonal and first superdiagonal of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal matrix B, and the elements above the first superdiagonal, with the array tau\_q, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; in lower case the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal matrix B, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array tau\_q, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors.

tau\_q

[out] Vector of the scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which represent the orthogonal matrix Q.

Return Value

Return true if successful, otherwise false in case of an [error](errorcodes.md).

Note

In upper case the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

    Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1)

Each H(i) has the form

    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

where tau is a scalar, and v is a vector with v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in tau\_q(i).

In lower case the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

    Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1)

Each H(i) has the form

    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

where tau is a scalar, and v is a vector with v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i), and tau in tau\_q(i). */

 

The contents of A on exit (output matrix reflect\_q) are illustrated by the following examples with n = 5:

```
  upper case:                          lower case:
 
  (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
  (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
  (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
  (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
  (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )
```

where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of B and vi denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).

Matrix Q can be produced with [ReflectTridiagonalToQ](reflectbidiagonaltoqp.md) method.

The input can be a symmetric, upper triangular or lower triangular matrix. Triangular matrices are assumed to be symmetric.
