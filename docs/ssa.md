Singular Spectrum Analysis

The section contains functions for decomposing a matrix into three components: orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix of singular values. SVD is applied to solve various linear algebra problems such as data dimensionality reduction, image compression, solving systems of equations, as well as data analysis and optimization. The main functions allow calculating singular values and vectors, reconstruct matrices, as well as approximate them with reduced rank accuracy.
