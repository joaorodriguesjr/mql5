Symbol Properties

To obtain the current market information there are several functions: [SymbolInfoInteger()](symbolinfointeger.md), [SymbolInfoDouble()](symbolinfodouble.md) and [SymbolInfoString()](symbolinfostring.md). The first parameter is the symbol name, the values of the second function parameter can be one of the identifiers of ENUM\_SYMBOL\_INFO\_INTEGER, ENUM\_SYMBOL\_INFO\_DOUBLE and ENUM\_SYMBOL\_INFO\_STRING.

| SYMBOL\_FORMULA | The formula used for the custom symbol pricing. If the name of a financial symbol used in the formula starts with a digit or contains a special character (">" ", ".", "-", "&", "#" and so on) quotation marks should be used around this symbol name.   * Synthetic symbol: "@ESU19"/EURCAD * Calendar spread: "Si-9.13"-"Si-6.13" * Euro index: 34.38805726 * pow(EURUSD,0.3155) * pow(EURGBP,0.3056) * pow(EURJPY,0.1891) * pow(EURCHF,0.1113) * pow(EURSEK,0.0785) | string |
| SYMBOL\_ISIN | The name of a symbol in the ISIN system (International Securities Identification Number). The International Securities Identification Number is a 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a security. The presence of this symbol property is determined on the side of a trade server. | string |
| SYMBOL\_PAGE | The address of the web page containing symbol information. This address will be displayed as a link when viewing symbol properties in the terminal | string |
| SYMBOL\_PATH | Path in the symbol tree | string |

 

A symbol price chart can be based on Bid or Last prices. The price selected for symbol charts also affects the generation and display of bars in the terminal. Possible values of the SYMBOL\_CHART\_MODE property are described in ENUM\_SYMBOL\_CHART\_MODE

ENUM\_SYMBOL\_CHART\_MODE

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SYMBOL\_CHART\_MODE\_BID | Bars are based on Bid prices |
| SYMBOL\_CHART\_MODE\_LAST | Bars are based on Last prices |

 

For each symbol several expiration modes of pending orders can be specified. A flag is matched to each mode. Flags can be combined using the operation of logical OR (|), for example, SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_GTC|SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_SPECIFIED. In order to check whether a certain mode is allowed for the symbol, the result of the logical AND (&) should be compared to the mode flag.

If flag SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_SPECIFIED is specified for a symbol, then while sending a pending order, you may specify the moment this pending order is valid till.

| Identifier | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_GTC | 1 | The order is valid during the unlimited time period, until it is explicitly canceled |
| SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_DAY | 2 | The order is valid till the end of the day |
| SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_SPECIFIED | 4 | The expiration time is specified in the order |
| SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_SPECIFIED\_DAY | 8 | The expiration date is specified in the order |

Example:

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks if the specified expiration mode is allowed               |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool IsExpirationTypeAllowed(string symbol,int exp_type)
  {
//--- Obtain the value of the property that describes allowed expiration modes
   int expiration=(int)SymbolInfoInteger(symbol,SYMBOL_EXPIRATION_MODE);
//--- Return true, if mode exp_type is allowed
   return((expiration&exp_type)==exp_type);
  }
```

 

If the SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_MODE property is set to SYMBOL\_EXPIRATION\_GTC (good till canceled), the expiration of pending orders, as well as of Stop Loss/Take Profit orders should be additionally set using the ENUM\_SYMBOL\_ORDER\_GTC\_MODE enumeration.

ENUM\_SYMBOL\_ORDER\_GTC\_MODE

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SYMBOL\_ORDERS\_GTC | Pending orders and Stop Loss/Take Profit levels are valid for an unlimited period until their explicit cancellation |
| SYMBOL\_ORDERS\_DAILY | Orders are valid during one trading day. At the end of the day, all Stop Loss and Take Profit levels, as well as pending orders are deleted. |
| SYMBOL\_ORDERS\_DAILY\_EXCLUDING\_STOPS | When a trade day changes, only pending orders are deleted, while Stop Loss and Take Profit levels are preserved. |

 

When sending an order, we can specify the filling policy of a volume set in the order. The possible volume-based order execution options for each symbol are specified in the table. It is possible to set several modes for each instrument via a combination of flags. The combination of flags is expressed by the logical OR (|) operation, for example SYMBOL\_FILLING\_FOK|SYMBOL\_FILLING\_IOC.  To check if a specific mode is allowed for an instrument, compare the logical AND (&) result with the mode flag - [example](marketinfoconstants.md#filling_example).

| Fill policy | ID | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fill or Kill | SYMBOL\_FILLING\_FOK | 1 | An order can be executed in the specified volume only.     If the necessary amount of a financial instrument is currently unavailable in the market, the order will not be executed. The desired volume can be made up of several available offers.     When sending an order, the [ORDER\_FILLING\_FOK](orderproperties.md#enum_order_type_filling) filling type should be specified for this policy.     The possibility of using FOK orders is determined at the trade server. |
| Immediate or Cancel | SYMBOL\_FILLING\_IOC | 2 | A trader agrees to execute a deal with the volume maximally available in the market within that indicated in the order. If the request cannot be filled completely, an order with the available volume will be executed, and the remaining volume will be canceled.     When sending an order, the [ORDER\_FILLING\_IOC](orderproperties.md#enum_order_type_filling) filling type should be specified for this policy.     The possibility of using IOC orders is determined at the trade server. |
| Passive | SYMBOL\_FILLING\_BOC | 4 | The BOC (Book-or-Cancel) policy assumes that an order can only be placed in the Depth of Market and cannot be immediately executed. If the order can be executed immediately when placed, then it is canceled.     In fact, this execution policy can only be specified when the price of the placed order is to be worse than the current market. BoC orders are used to implement passive trading, so that the order is not executed immediately when placed and does not affect current liquidity.     Only limit and stop limit orders are supported, i.e. the [SYMBOL\_ORDER\_MODE](marketinfoconstants.md#symbol_order_mode) flag should contain the SYMBOL\_ORDER\_LIMIT and/or SYMBOL\_ORDER\_STOP\_LIMIT values. |
| Return | No identifier |  | In case of partial filling, a market or limit order with remaining volume is not canceled but processed further.     When sending an order, the [ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN](orderproperties.md#enum_order_type_filling) filling type should be specified for this policy.     Return orders are not allowed in the Market Execution mode (market execution SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_MARKET). |

When sending a trade request using the [OrderSend()](ordersend.md) function, the necessary volume execution policy can be set in the type\_filling field, namely in the special [MqlTradeRequest](mqltraderequest.md) structure. The values from the [ENUM\_ORDER\_TYPE\_FILLING](orderproperties.md#enum_order_type_filling) enumeration are available.  If no filling type is specified, ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN is automatically set in the trade request. The ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN filling type is enabled in any [execution mode](marketinfoconstants.md#enum_symbol_trade_execution) except for "Market execution" (SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_MARKET).

While sending a trade request for execution at the current time (time in force), we should keep in mind that financial markets provide no guarantee that the entire requested volume is available for a certain financial instrument at the desired price. Therefore, trading operations in real time are regulated using the price and volume execution modes. The modes, or execution policies, define the rules for cases when the price has changed or the requested volume cannot be completely fulfilled at the moment.

| Execution mode | Description | The value in [ENUM\_SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION](marketinfoconstants.md#symbol_filling_mode) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution mode     (Request Execution) | Executing a market order at the price previously received from the broker.     Prices for a certain market order are requested from the broker before the order is sent. Upon receiving the prices, order execution at the given price can be either confirmed or rejected. | SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_REQUEST |
| Instant Execution | Executing a market order at the specified price immediately.     When sending a trade request to be executed, the platform automatically adds the current prices to the order.   * If the broker accepts the price, the order is executed. * If the broker does not accept the requested price, a "Requote" is sent the broker returns prices, at which this order can be executed. | SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_INSTANT |
| Market Execution | A broker makes a decision about the order execution price without any additional discussion with the trader.     Sending the order in such a mode means advance consent to its execution at this price. | SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_MARKET |
| Exchange Execution | Trade operations are executed at the prices of the current market offers. | SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_EXCHANGE |

Before sending an order with the current execution time, for the correct setting of the [ORDER\_TYPE\_FILLING](orderproperties.md#enum_order_property_integer) value (volume execution type), you can use the [SymbolInfoInteger()](symbolinfointeger.md) function with each financial instrument to get the [SYMBOL\_FILLING\_MODE](marketinfoconstants.md#enum_symbol_info_integer) property value, which shows [volume execution types](marketinfoconstants.md#symbol_filling_mode) allowed for the symbol as a combination of flags. The ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN filling type is enabled at all times except for the "Market execution" mode (SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_MARKET).

The use of filling types depending on the execution mode can be shown as the following table:

| Type of Execution\Fill Policy | Fill or Kill (FOK ORDER\_FILLING\_FOK) | Immediate or Cancel (IOC ORDER\_FILLING\_IOC) | Return (Return ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instant Execution     (SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_INSTANT) | + (regardless of a symbol setting) | + (regardless of a symbol setting) | + (always) |
| Request Execution     SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_REQUEST | + (regardless of a symbol setting) | + (regardless of a symbol setting) | + (always) |
| Market Execution     SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_MARKET | + (set in the symbol settings) | + (set in the symbol settings) | - (disabled regardless of the symbol settings) |
| Exchange Execution     SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXECUTION\_EXCHANGE | + (set in the symbol settings) | + (set in the symbol settings) | + (always) |

In case of pending orders, the ORDER\_FILLING\_RETURN filling type should be used regardless of an execution type ([SYMBOL\_TRADE\_EXEMODE](marketinfoconstants.md#enum_symbol_trade_execution)), since such orders are not meant for execution at the time of sending. When using pending orders, a trader agrees in advance that, when conditions for a deal on this order are met, the broker will use the filling type supported by the exchange.

Example:

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| check if a given filling mode is allowed                         |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool IsFillingTypeAllowed(string symbol,int fill_type)
  {
//--- get the value of the property describing the filling mode
   int filling=(int)SymbolInfoInteger(symbol,SYMBOL_FILLING_MODE);
//--- return 'true' if the fill_type mode is allowed
   return((filling&fill_type)==fill_type);
  }
```

 

When sending a [trade request](mqltraderequest.md) using OrderSend() function, an order type from [ENUM\_ORDER\_TYPE enumeration](orderproperties.md#enum_order_type) should be specified for some operations. Not all types of orders may be allowed for a specific symbol. [SYMBOL\_ORDER\_MODE](marketinfoconstants.md#enum_symbol_info_integer) property describes the flags of the allowed order types.

| Identifier | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_MARKET | 1 | Market orders are allowed (Buy and Sell) |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_LIMIT | 2 | Limit orders are allowed (Buy Limit and Sell Limit) |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_STOP | 4 | Stop orders are allowed (Buy Stop and Sell Stop) |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_STOP\_LIMIT | 8 | Stop-limit orders are allowed (Buy Stop Limit and Sell Stop Limit) |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_SL | 16 | Stop Loss is allowed |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_TP | 32 | Take Profit is allowed |
| SYMBOL\_ORDER\_CLOSEBY | 64 | Close By operation is allowed, i.e. closing a position by another open position on the same instruments but in the opposite direction. The property is set for accounts with the hedging accounting system ([ACCOUNT\_MARGIN\_MODE\_RETAIL\_HEDGING](accountinformation.md#enum_account_margin_mode)) |

Example:

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| The function prints out order types allowed for a symbol         |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void Check_SYMBOL_ORDER_MODE(string symbol)
  {
//--- receive the value of the property describing allowed order types
   int symbol_order_mode=(int)SymbolInfoInteger(symbol,SYMBOL_ORDER_MODE);
//--- check for market orders (Market Execution)
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_MARKET&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_MARKET)
      Print(symbol+": Market orders are allowed (Buy and Sell)");
//--- check for Limit orders
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_LIMIT&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_LIMIT)
      Print(symbol+": Buy Limit and Sell Limit orders are allowed");
//--- check for Stop orders
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_STOP&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_STOP)
      Print(symbol+": Buy Stop and Sell Stop orders are allowed");
//--- check for Stop Limit orders
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_STOP_LIMIT&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_STOP_LIMIT)
      Print(symbol+": Buy Stop Limit and Sell Stop Limit orders are allowed");
//--- check if placing a Stop Loss orders is allowed
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_SL&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_SL)
      Print(symbol+": Stop Loss orders are allowed");
//--- check if placing a Take Profit orders is allowed
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_TP&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_TP)
      Print(symbol+": Take Profit orders are allowed");
//--- check if closing a position by an opposite one is allowed
   if((SYMBOL_ORDER_TP&symbol_order_mode)==SYMBOL_ORDER_CLOSEBY)
      Print(symbol+": Close by allowed");
//---
  }
```
