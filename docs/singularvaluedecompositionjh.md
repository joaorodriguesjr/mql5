Parameters

joba

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_A](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_a) enumeration value determining the accuracy level of the SVD computation.

jobu

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_U](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_u) enumeration value that determines how the left singular vectors should be computed.

jobv

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_V](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_v) enumeration value that determines how the right singular vectors should be computed.

jobr

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_R](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_r) enumeration value defining the range of computable values

jobt

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_T](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_t) enumeration value defining whether to transpose the matrix of it is square. If the matrix is non-square, this parameter is ignored.

jobp

[in] [ENUM\_SVDJH\_P](singularvaluedecompositionjh.md#enum_svdjh_p) enumeration value defining the possibility of structured perturbations to remove denormalized values.

S

[out] Vector of singular values.

For work(1)/work(2) = one: the singular values of A. During the computation S contains Euclidean column norms of the iterated matrices in the array a.

For work(1)≠work(2): the singular values of A are (work(1)/work(2)) * S(1:n). This factored form is used if sigma\_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.

jobr = 'R', some of the singular values may be returned as exact zeros obtained by 'setting to zero' because they are below the numerical rank threshold or are denormalized numbers.

U

[out] Matrix of left singular vectors.

V

[out] Matrix of right singular vectors.

work\_results

[out] Vector consisting of 7 statistics obtained as a result of the computation.

work(1) = scale = work(2)/work(1) is the scaling factor such that scale*sva(1:n) are the computed singular values of A. See the description of S.

work(2) = see the description of work(1).

work(3) = sconda is an estimate for the condition number of column equilibrated A. If joba = 'E' or 'G', sconda is an estimate of sqrt(||(R**t * R)**(-1)||\_1). It is computed using ?pocon. It holds n**(-1/4) * sconda ≤ ||R**(-1)||\_2 ≤ n**(1/4) * sconda, where R is the triangular factor from the QRF of A. However, if R is truncated and the numerical rank is determined to be strictly smaller than n, sconda is returned as -1, indicating that the smallest singular values might be lost.

If full SVD is needed, the following two condition numbers are useful for the analysis of the algorithm. They are provied for a user who is familiar with the details of the method.

work(4) = an estimate of the scaled condition number of the triangular factor in the first QR factorization.

work(5) = an estimate of the scaled condition number of the triangular factor in the second QR factorization.

The following two parameters are computed if jobt = 'T'. They are provided for a user who is familiar with the details of the method.

work(6) = the entropy of A**t*A :: this is the Shannon entropy of diag(A**t*A) / Trace(A**t*A) taken as point in the probability simplex.

work(7) = the entropy of A*A**t.

Return Value

Return true if successful, otherwise false in case of an [error](errorcodes.md).

Note

The number of matrix rows must not be less than the number of columns.
