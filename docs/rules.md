Precedence Rules

Each group of operations in the table has the same priority. The higher the priority of operations is, the higher it is position of the group in the table. The precedence rules determine the grouping of operations and operands.

Attention: Precedence of operations in the MQL5 language corresponds to the priority adopted in C++, and differs from the priority given in the MQL4 language.

| Operation | Desciption | Execution Order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ()  []  . | Function Call  Referencing to an array element  Referencing to a structure element | From left to right |
| !  ~    ++  --  (type)  sizeof | Logical negation  Bitwise negation (complement)  Sign changing  Increment by one  Decrement by one  Typecasting  Determining size in bytes | Right to left |
| *  /  % | Multiplication  Division  Module division | From left to right |
| + | Addition  Subtraction | From left to right |
| <<  >> | Left shift  Right shift | From left to right |
| <  <=  >  >= | Less than  Less than or equal  Greater than  Greater than or equal | From left to right |
| ==  != | Equal  Not equal | From left to right |
| & | Bitwise AND operation | From left to right |
| ^ | Bitwise exclusive OR | From left to right |
| | | Bitwise OR operation | From left to right |
| && | Logical AND operation | From left to right |
| || | Logical OR operation | From left to right |
| ?: | Conditional Operator | Right to left |
| =  *=  /=  %=  +=  -=  <<=  >>=  &=  ^=  |= | Assignment  Multiplication with assignment  Division with assignment  Module with assignment  Addition with assignment  Subtraction with assignment  Left shift with assignment  Right shift with assignment  Bitwise AND with assignment  Exclusive OR with assignment  Bitwise OR with assignment | Right to left |
| , | Comma | From left to right |

To change the operation execution order, parenthesis that are of higher priority are used.
