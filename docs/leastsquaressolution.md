LeastSquaresSolution

Solves overdetermined or underdetermined real / complex linear systems involving an m-by-n matrix A, or its transpose / conjugate-transpose, using a QR or LQ factorization of A. It is assumed that A has full rank.

The following options are provided:

1. If trans = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem minimize || B - A*X ||.

2. If trans = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of an underdetermined system A * X = B.

3. If trans = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of an underdetermined system A**T * X = B.

4. If trans = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem minimize || B - A**T * X ||.

Parameters

trans

[in]  ENUM\_EQUATIONS\_FORM enumeration value which specifies the form of the system of equations.

B

[in]  Matrix B whose columns are the right-hand sides for the systems of equations. Vector B contains one column of right-hand side.

X

[out]  Matrix or vector X with solutions of linear least squares problem.

residuals

[out]  Matrix or vector with the residual sum of squares for the solution in each column, given by the sum of squares of modulus of elements in that column. If trans='N' and m<=n or trans!='N' and m>=n, then residuals matrix (vector) is empty.

 

Return Value

Return true if successful, otherwise false in case of an [error](errorcodes.md).

Note

If trans='N'. Matrix B must be of size m-by-nrhs, where nrhs is number of right-hand side vectors, matrix X is of size n-by-nrhs. If m>=n, matrix X contains nrhs least squares solution vectors. If m<n, matrix X contains nrhs minimum norm solution vectors.

If trans!='N'. Matrix B must be of size n-by-nrhs, matrix X is of size m-by-nrhs. If m>=n, matrix X contains nrhs minimum norm solution vectors. If m<n, matrix X contains nrhs least squares solution vectors.

 

ENUM\_EQUATIONS\_FORM

An enumeration defining which form of the equations' system calculated.

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| EQUATIONSFORM\_N | 'N': the linear system involves A (No transpose) |
| EQUATIONSFORM\_T | 'T': the linear system involves A**T (Transpose) |
| EQUATIONSFORM\_C | 'C': the linear system involves A**H (Conjugate transpose) |

In case of real matrices the value EQUATIONSFORM\_C assumed as Transpose.

In case of complex matrices the value EQUATIONSFORM\_T assumed as Conjugate transpose.
