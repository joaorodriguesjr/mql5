Deal Properties

A deal is the reflection of the fact of a [trade operation](enum_trade_request_actions.md) execution based on an [order](orderproperties.md) that contains a trade request. Each trade is described by properties that allow to obtain information about it. In order to read values of properties, functions of the HistoryDealGet...() type are used, that return values from corresponding enumerations.

| --- | --- | --- |
| DEAL\_TICKET | Deal ticket. Unique number assigned to each deal | long |
| DEAL\_ORDER | Deal [order number](historyordergetticket.md) | long |

Each deal is characterized by a type, allowed values are enumerated in ENUM\_DEAL\_TYPE. In order to obtain information about the deal type, use the [HistoryDealGetInteger()](historydealgetinteger.md) function with the DEAL\_TYPE modifier.

ENUM\_DEAL\_TYPE

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_BUY | Buy |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL | Sell |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_BALANCE | Balance |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_CREDIT | Credit |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_CHARGE | Additional charge |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_CORRECTION | Correction |

| DEAL\_TYPE\_BUY\_CANCELED | Canceled buy deal. There can be a situation when a previously executed buy deal is canceled. In this case, the type of the previously executed deal (DEAL\_TYPE\_BUY) is changed to DEAL\_TYPE\_BUY\_CANCELED, and its profit/loss is zeroized. Previously obtained profit/loss is charged/withdrawn using a separated balance operation |
| DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL\_CANCELED | Canceled sell deal. There can be a situation when a previously executed sell deal is canceled. In this case, the type of the previously executed deal (DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL) is changed to DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL\_CANCELED, and its profit/loss is zeroized.

Deals differ not only in their types set in ENUM\_DEAL\_TYPE, but also in the way they change positions. This can be a simple position opening, or accumulation of a previously opened position (market entering), position closing by an opposite deal of a corresponding volume (market exiting), or position reversing, if the opposite-direction deal covers the volume of the previously opened position.

All these situations are described by values from the ENUM\_DEAL\_ENTRY enumeration. In order to receive this information about a deal, use the [HistoryDealGetInteger()](historydealgetinteger.md) function with the DEAL\_ENTRY modifier.

ENUM\_DEAL\_ENTRY

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_IN | Entry in |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT | Entry out |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_INOUT | Reverse |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT\_BY | Close a position by an opposite one |

 

The reason for deal execution is contained in the DEAL\_REASON property. A deal can be executed as a result of triggering of an order placed from a mobile application or an MQL5 program, as well as as a result of the StopOut event, variation margin calculation, etc. Possible values of DEAL\_REASON are described in the ENUM\_DEAL\_REASON enumeration. For non-trading deals resulting from balance, credit, commission and other operations, DEAL\_REASON\_CLIENT is indicated as the reason.
